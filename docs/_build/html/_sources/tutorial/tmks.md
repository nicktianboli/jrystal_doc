# Equivalence between Total Energy Minimization and Solving Kohn-Sham Equation

In this tutorial, we will show that the total energy minimization is equivalent to solving the Kohn-Sham equation, which is the theoretical foundation of the our direct minimization approach for solving the Kohn-Sham Equation.
