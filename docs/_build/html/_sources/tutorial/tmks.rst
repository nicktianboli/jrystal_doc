Equivalence Between Total Energy Minimization and Solving Kohn-Sham Equation
===============================================================


In this tutorial, we will show that the total energy minimization is equivalent to solving the Kohn-Sham equation, which is the theoretical foundation of the our direct minimization approach for solving the Kohn-Sham Equation.

    If you are not familiar with the total energy minimization, please refer to the tutorial :ref:`total_energy`.


Kohn-Sham Equation
-----------------

In practical applications of DFT, there is a significant reliance on the Kohn-Sham equation. Kohn and Sham proposed that the many-electron wavefunction can be represented as a sum of the single-electron wavefunctions, which are called Kohn-Sham orbitals. The Kohn-Sham equation is a single-particle equation that can be solved using the plane wave basis set.
